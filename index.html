                <p>I am a United States Army Veteran with a Bachelors Degree in Computer Information Technology and with over 3 years as an IT professional. I am currently employed with BlackLine, where I am recognized for my discipline and dedication on analyzing and testing application issues reported by clients and found internally. I proved my ability to work with an interdisciplinary team, developed valuable communication skills, and have been able to build strong professional relationships with clients, peers and superiors.
                    <br>Throughout my professional career and education, I have gained a solid amount of knowledge on a variety of operating systems, software development tools, networking and file systems. I enjoy being challenged by being part of projects that require me to work outside my comfort zone. This allows me to continue to learn and grow new systems, languages, and development techniques.</p>
